# Tip calculator 
 
 Create a Tip calculator (or rather a function for a tip calculator). 
 
 For any number of guests sharing a restaurant bill, calculate how much tip each guest needs to pay. 
 
Use variables to store the number of guests, the amount of the bill and the tip in percentage.

# Example 
        
        guest = 2;
        bill = 80;
        tipPercentage = 10;
        
# Challange

Create a function which takes these values as input and outputs the total amount each guest needs to pay as well as the amount of tip that is included, eg `Each guest needs to pay: 44 euro` and `The amount of tip for each guest is: 4 euro`.
