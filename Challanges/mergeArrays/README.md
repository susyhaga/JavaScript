# Merge 2 arrays without their repetitions

Create a function that will receive two arrays of numbers as arguments and return an array
 composed of all the numbers that are either in the first array or second array but not in both.
 
 
# For example:


var ar1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

var ar2 = [5, 9, 6, 2];


var ar3 = mergeExclusive(ar1, ar2);

ar3 should be equal to = [1, 3, 4, 9, 6]
