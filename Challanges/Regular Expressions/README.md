Using Regular Expressions practice:
# Write a function that given a string 'str' and a 

single character (string) 'x' returns:

1) groups = How many 'groups' of x exist in str 
2) count = How many times the character x appears in str in total

A group of x are consecutive occurences of x.

# For example:

str = "Mississippi"
x = "s"

groups = 2 / count = 4

str = "Mississippi"
x = "i"

groups = 4 / count = 4

- Solve it using Regular Expressions
- Solve it without using Regular Expressions
- Try to measure which solution is faster
- What happens if instead of searching for a single character we should search 
  for a substring / multiple characters? For example x = "ssi"
