# JavaScript Challenges 

Every developer needs to build their skills and coding challenges are a good way to do this. This repo is an example that I provide to show a sample structure of my repo,demonstrating some challenges and solutions in JS language, some ways of utilizing the readme.md file to make my repo's more interesting,
the importance of comments in my code for other's reading my code,methods for generating documention and how to utilize tests for code evaluation

# Skills

In the most basic terms, a developers job is to solve problems. These problems can range from something of great scientific or national importance, through to something trivial or fun. 

# The general steps that you follow are:

Identify the overall problem
Break it in to smaller tasks
Write psudeo code for tasks
Convert psudeo code to the programming language of your choice
Test
Document your solution
You will often need to do steps 3-5 multiple times as there are factors that you forgot to consider and the documentation should be done throughout the coding process but often isn't.
